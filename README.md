<h4>Lab1 - Computer Memory </h4>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate various concepts related to computer memory, such as data representation, endianness, and sign extension. You must do Part 1 of this lab on your own, prior to coming to the microprocessor lab.</p>

<h4>Lab2 - Memory Operations, Loops, and Conditionals </h4>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to familiarize you with Nios II assembly language programming and using the debugger to observe how your program functions.</p>

<br>
<h4>Lab3 - Subroutines and C</h4>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to introduce subroutines, by writing assembly language subroutines that call and are called by C subroutines.</p>

<h4>Lab1 - Computer Memory </h4>
<p>In this lab you will learn how to use the Parallel Interface (JP1/JP2 connectors on the DE2 board) to communicate with another piece of hardware, the Lego controller. The Lego controller connects to motors and sensors, allowing your program to interact with the physical world. You will also learn how to use the Timer peripheral on the DE2 computer to measure delay intervals.</p>
